# P-controlled buck converter with a moving average filter.

The overall goal of this project is to create a buck converter with a feedback control system.  
In addition to this objective, the following parameters were given when de-signing the buck converter:
* Output Voltage Ripple = 2.66%
* Inductor Value = 500uH
* Voltage Input (Vin) = 7V
* Voltage Output (Vout) = 0-7V
* Switching Frequency = 10kHz

In  order  to  design  a  buck  converter  with  feedback  control,  a  digital  approach  VIA microcontroller implementation was utilized.  
This power supply utilizes the Arduino UNO microcontroller to account perform voltage stabilization and adjusting the volt-age output.
